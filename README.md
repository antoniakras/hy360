# Retail-Transactions-System – Java Servlets & SQL Backend Application  

## 🚀 About  
This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a **Java web application using Servlets, JDBC, and SQL**, deployed on an **Apache Tomcat container**. It follows a **REST-style architecture**, exposing endpoints for data management and interaction with a relational database.  

The application highlights skills in **backend development**, **database schema design**, and **complex SQL queries**, combined with practical deployment experience in a **Java EE environment**.

## 📂 Features  
- **Java Servlets backend** – request handling and business logic  
- **REST-style API** – structured endpoints for CRUD operations  
- **Relational database integration** – via JDBC and SQL  
- **E-R diagram design** – translating requirements into database schema  
- **Tricky SQL queries** – involving joins, aggregations, nested queries, and constraints  
- **Deployment** – configured and run in an **Apache Tomcat servlet container**

## 🛠️ Setup & Run  

1. Install [Apache Tomcat](https://tomcat.apache.org/) (tested with v9+).  
2. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:antoniakras/hy360.git
   cd hy360
3. Deploy the .war file or the compiled classes to your Tomcat webapps/ directory.

4. Start Tomcat and access the application via: http://localhost:8080/hy360\

## 📊 Database Design

Entity–Relationship Diagram (E-R) included to illustrate schema.

Schema covers entities, relationships, keys, and constraints.

Showcases normalization and mapping to SQL.

🔍 Queries Highlight

* The project goes beyond basic CRUD and demonstrates:

* Multi-table JOINs to fetch aggregated information

* Nested subqueries for filtering and reporting

* Group by + Having for advanced analytics

* Referential integrity checks with constraints

* Performance-aware query design
